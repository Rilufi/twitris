A bot that lets [Twitter play Tetris](http://twitter.com/rilufix). [Faster version](https://observablehq.com/@chriszs/emojitris) on Observable.

## This fork

Included some python code for my other bots to comment random commands for the next step of the game.

Runs a GitHub Action to tweet on an interval. Reads and saves game state to the `save` branch.
